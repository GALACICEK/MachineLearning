## PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) 
are both dimensionality reduction techniques, but they serve different purposes and have distinct approaches:


|              | PCA                             |     LDA         | 
| ----------- | -----------                     | -----------     |       
| Goal :      | To find the directions (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data and reduce dimensions.|To find the projection that best separates different classes.|
| Data Type:  | Can be used with both labeled and unlabeled data.|Requires labeled data.|
| Output :    | Projects the data onto a new coordinate system based on directions of maximum variance.| Projects the data in a way that maximizes class separability.|
| Features:  | Focuses on capturing the maximum variance, does not use class labels.| Uses class information to maximize the separation between classes.|

### Summary
PCA focuses on capturing the maximum variance in the data, while LDA aims to maximize the separation between predefined classes.
